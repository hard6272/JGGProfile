Review 1:

Tried in iOS simulator - does not load in Android simulator. Some alignment issues with text boxes, view does not maintain proper layout with orientation change. These issues might be iOS-related. 
Color scheme is good, dark background with light text. Code looks good as well, no errors and well-organized.
Navigation button present between cover and info pages, as well as social media links.
